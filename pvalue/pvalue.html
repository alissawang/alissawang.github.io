    <h1>P-Value</h1>
    <br>
    <div id="page1">
        <p class="inline-block">Your local pizzeria advertises an average delivery time of exactly 35 minutes. 
            You're pretty sure it takes longer than that, so you collect some
            data from 40 neighbors on how long it took to deliver their pizzas.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="inline-block">The average time of the deliveries you surveyed was 38 minutes, with a standard
            deviation of 2 minutes. Is your pizzeria's advertising accurate?</p>
        <br>
        <p class="inline-block">Let's say the pizzeria is correct that the average delivery time is 35 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="inline-block">If we did this experiment over and over again, we'd get slightly different average
            delivery times circling around 35 minutes. We could construct the distribution graph below, which shows the 
            probability of obtaining any given average delivery time in an experiment.
            Mouse over to see:
        </p>
        <div id="intro-graph">
            <div class="coordinate-display"></div>
            <div class="coordinate-circle"></div>
        </div>
        <p class="inline-block">(Assuming a normal sampling distribution).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="inline-block">Intuitively, the probability of collecting an average delivery time much lower or higher
            than 35 minutes is very, very low compared to delivery times closer to 35 minutes. So if we see an average time
            of 40 minutes, which we see in this graph is very unlikely, then we might be inclined 
            to conclude that the pizzeria's estimate is wrong. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="inline-block">So where do we draw the line?</p>
